# Haskell-coursework

This was the coursework for the functional programming coursework. The goal was to solve a series of tasks of increasing difficulty. Comments explaining the methods can be found in the cw.hs file.

## The tasks

### Task 1

Take three int inputs, in the form of m n p and create return a String that can be displayed as p steps, of height m and width n. Looking like steps.

### Task 2

Create a method that takes a positive Int value greater than or equal to five and returns a String that can be displayed as a fflag with a X in th middle. The X touches the corners of the flag.

### Task 3

Create a function that takes three String values w1 w2 s, and returns s with all occurrences of the String w1, in the String s, replaced by the String w2.

### Task 4

Define a function compatibility, that takes two String values representing persons names, and outputs their compatibility.

Depending on the positioned of the removed letter we can determine the compatibility of the name inputted.

### Task 5

Define a polymorphic function split that is applied to two arguments of types [a] and a, where a is a type on which == is def ined, and returns a list of lists that partitions the original list at occurrences of the second argument
